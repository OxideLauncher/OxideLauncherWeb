Hey there! 👋

We're excited to introduce Oxide Launcher, a new way to play Minecraft. If you've ever felt like existing launchers are either too slow, too cluttered, or missing features you need, we built Oxide with you in mind.

## Why another launcher?

Good question. There are already great options like Prism Launcher and the Modrinth App. We're not trying to replace them — we just wanted to combine things we liked from each:

- Prism's powerful instance management
- Modrinth App's modern tech stack
- Our own ideas about what makes a launcher pleasant to use

The result is something we're proud of, and we think you might like it too.

## Where do I start? 

I would not recommend using the launcher in it's current state. It's very rough around the edges and breakign changes happen every day. 

However, check back in a few days, weeks or even months and by then it might be something worth using!

## What's next?

We're actively working on:

- The website. There are tons of placeholder assets and some navigation likely does not function as intended. 
- Linux and macOS builds (Windows is the focus for now)
- Import/export for instances
- Quality of life improvements based on your feedback

If you run into any issues or have ideas for features, let us know on GitHub. We're building this for the community, and your input matters.

Thanks for checking out Oxide!
