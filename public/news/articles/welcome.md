Hey there! 👋

We're excited to introduce Oxide Launcher, a new way to play Minecraft. If you've ever felt like existing launchers are either too slow, too cluttered, or missing features you need, we built Oxide with you in mind.

## What is Oxide?

Oxide is a Minecraft launcher built from scratch using Rust and React. That means:

- **Fast startup times** — the launcher opens in milliseconds, not seconds
- **Low memory usage** — Oxide stays light so your system resources go to Minecraft
- **Modern interface** — clean design with dark and light themes
- **Multi-platform mod support** — search and install from both CurseForge and Modrinth

## Why another launcher?

Good question. There are already great options like Prism Launcher and the Modrinth App. We're not trying to replace them — we just wanted to combine things we liked from each:

- Prism's powerful instance management
- Modrinth App's modern tech stack
- Our own ideas about what makes a launcher pleasant to use

The result is something we're proud of, and we think you might like it too.

## Getting started

1. Head to the [download page](/download) and grab the latest release
2. Run the installer
3. Create your first instance
4. Play!

It really is that simple. No mandatory account, no telemetry, no hidden settings.

## Open source

Oxide is licensed under GPL-3.0, which means the source code is completely open. You can:

- Read through the code to see exactly what it does
- Report bugs or request features
- Fork it and make your own version
- Contribute improvements back to the project

Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OxideLauncher/OxideLauncher) if you're interested.

## What's next?

We're actively working on:

- Linux and macOS builds (Windows is the focus for now)
- More modloader support
- Import/export for instances
- Quality of life improvements based on your feedback

If you run into any issues or have ideas for features, let us know on GitHub. We're building this for the community, and your input matters.

Thanks for checking out Oxide!
