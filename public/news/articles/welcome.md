Hey there! 👋

We're excited to introduce Oxide Launcher, a new way to play Minecraft. If you've ever felt like existing launchers are either too slow, too cluttered, or missing features you need, we built Oxide with you in mind.

## Why another launcher?

Good question. There are already great options like Prism Launcher, Curseforge and the Modrinth App. We're not trying to replace them — we just wanted to combine things we liked from each:

- Prism's powerful instance management
- Modrinth App's modern tech stack
- Our own ideas about what makes a launcher pleasant to use

The result is something we're proud of, and we think you might like it too.

## Where can I download it? I want to play! 

We do not recommend a regular user to use the launcher in it's current state. It's very rough around the edges and breaking changes happen every day. 

There are no publicly available downloads yet, we don't have any workflows setup, and lots of things in the launcher straight-up don't work yet. 

However, check back in a few days, weeks or even months and by then it might be something worth using!

Right now, we are focusing on getting the core of the launcher to a state that we feel comfortable with sharing builds to the public. 

Developers, or folks with the technical know-how can obviously compile the launcher from source anytime, but then again, it's rust. So it might not compile at all if we are tinkering. 

## What do we currently have that's worth sharing? 

- We have largely settled on the base design of the UI. However, this still may change in the future if we decide that we dont like it. 
- The launcher downloads multiple files/modpacks insanely fast. You can even change the limit to go higher.
- Our own instance archive format: .Oxide
- Global and instance-specific settings. 
- Fancy Mod, Modpack, Resource Pack and Shader Pack download dialogues with all the good stuff like queuing, a rendered description of the mod's page, and auto-dependency management.

## What's next?

We're actively working on:

- The launcher's internals. It's still very buggy and getting modloaders and legacy versions to play nice is not a simple task. 
- The website. There are tons of placeholder assets and some navigation likely does not function as intended. 
- Linux and macOS builds (Windows is the focus for now)
- The UI/UX of the launcher. We want it to look nice, but also to feel smooth and responsive. Expect many changes to the interface as we iterate. 
- Quality of life improvements, and of course, adding features that other launchers don't have. 

If you run into any issues or have ideas for features, let us know on GitHub. We're building this for the community, and your input matters.

Thanks for checking out Oxide!
