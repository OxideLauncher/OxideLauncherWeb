One of the most requested features in any Minecraft launcher is proper multi-instance support. We're happy to say Oxide handles this well.

## What does multi-instance mean?

Instead of having one Minecraft installation that you constantly modify, you can create separate "instances" — each with its own:

- Minecraft version
- Mods and modloaders
- Resource packs
- Worlds
- Settings

This means you can have a 1.20.4 instance with Fabric mods for playing with friends, a 1.19.2 Forge instance for that one modpack you love, and a vanilla 1.21 instance for testing new features — all without any conflicts.

## How it works in Oxide

Creating a new instance takes about 30 seconds:

1. Click "New Instance" on the main screen
2. Choose your Minecraft version
3. (Optionally) select a modloader and version
4. Give it a name
5. Done!

Each instance gets its own folder, so there's zero chance of mods from one setup breaking another.

## Importing existing instances

If you're coming from another launcher, you can import your existing instances. Just point Oxide at the instance folder and it'll handle the rest.

## Tips for managing instances

- **Use descriptive names** — "1.20.4 Fabric" is better than "Instance 1"
- **Group by purpose** — modded survival, creative building, server testing, etc.
- **Don't be afraid to create temporary instances** — they're cheap to make and easy to delete

We'll be adding more instance management features in future updates, including folders/groups and better search.
