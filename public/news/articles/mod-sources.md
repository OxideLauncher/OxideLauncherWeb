Finding mods shouldn't require juggling multiple websites and manually copying files. Oxide brings both CurseForge and Modrinth into one search.

## Why both platforms?

Some mods are only on CurseForge. Some are only on Modrinth. Many are on both. By supporting both platforms, Oxide makes sure you're never stuck hunting for a download.

This is a practical decision, not a political one. Both platforms serve the community, and we want Oxide to work with whatever mods you need.

## How to search for mods

1. Open an instance
2. Go to the Mods tab
3. Click "Add Mods"
4. Search by name or browse categories

The search results show mods from both platforms, with clear labels so you know where each one comes from. Click to install, and Oxide handles downloading the right version for your modloader.

## Updating mods

When a mod has an update available, you'll see it in the instance's mod list. Update individually or all at once — your choice.

## What about dependencies?

Oxide automatically handles mod dependencies. If a mod requires a library like Fabric API or Cloth Config, we'll prompt you to install it too.

## Coming soon

We're working on:

- Better mod compatibility checking
- Modpack browsing and one-click installs
- Mod profiles (save and load mod configurations)

Got a mod that's not showing up in search? Let us know and we'll investigate.
